We are in no position
to go anywhere or do anything.
Our support ships
have all been destroyed.
Send reinforcements to you, we will.
Master Yoda? Master Yoda?
We've lost the transmission, sir.
We have to leave orbit immediately.
More enemy ships have just arrived.
We'll get back to you as soon as we can.
Well, I guess we'll have to hold out
a little longer.
My apologies, young one.
It's time for a proper introduction.
I'm the new Padawan learner.
I'm Ahsoka Tano.
I'm Obi-Wan Kenobi, your new master.
I'm at your service, Master Kenobi
but I'm afraid I've actually been assigned
to Master Skywalker.
What? No, no, no.
There must be some mistake.
He's the one who wanted the Padawan.
No, Master Yoda was very specific.
I'm assigned to Anakin Skywalker,
and he is to supervise my Jedi training.
But that doesn't make any sense.
We'll have to sort this out later.
It won't be long before those droids
figure out a way around our cannons.
I'll check on Rex in the lookout post.
You'd better take her with you.
I have brought Jabba's son
to the abandoned monastery.
He will be safe here.
Good, good.
Everything is going as planned.
Yes, my lord.
Soon the Jedi will not only be
at war with you, Count
but the Hutt clan as well.
What's the status, Rex?
Quiet for now, sir.
They're gearing up for another assault.
Who's the youngling?
I'm Master Skywalker's Padawan.
The name's Ahsoka Tano.
Sir, I thought you said
you'd never have a Padawan.
There's been a mix-up.
The youngling isn't with me.
Stop calling me that!
You're stuck with me, Skyguy.
What did you just call me?
Don't get snippy with me, little one.
You know, I don't even think
you're old enough to be a Padawan.
Well, maybe I'm not,
but Master Yoda thinks I am.
Well, you're not with Master Yoda now.
So, if you're ready,
you better start proving it.
Captain Rex will show you how
a little respect can go a long way.
Right.
Come on, youngling.
Padawan.
Have you thought about
moving that line back, Captain?
They'd have better cover that way.
Thanks for the suggestion
but General Skywalker thinks
they're fine where they are.
So, if you're a captain and I'm a Jedi
then, technically, I outrank you, right?
In my book, experience
outranks everything.
Well, if experience outranks everything,
I guess I better start getting some.
What's that?
Not good. They've got an energy shield.
That's gonna make things
damn near impossible.
If you wanted experience, little one
it looks like you're about to get plenty.
What is it?
The clones are pulling back
and the lead tanks are now
approaching the city center.
Get to those heavy cannons
as quickly as you can!
The shield generator is
somewhere in this area.
They're slowly increasing the diameter,
and keeping it just ahead of their troops.
Heavy cannons
are gonna be useless against that.
As they get closer, I suppose we could
try to draw them into the buildings.
That might level the playing field a bit.
If that shield's gonna be such a problem,
why don't we just take it out?
Easier said than done.
Well, I, for one, agree with her.
Someone has to get to that
shield generator and destroy it.
That's the key.
Right, then. Maybe you two
can tiptoe through the enemy lines.
and solve
this particular problem together.
Can do, Master Kenobi.
I'll decide what we do.
If Rex and I can engage them here
you two might have a chance to get
through their lines undetected, here.
They won't have much time.
The droids far outnumber us
so our ability to street fight is limited
without the use of heavy cannons.
They will march forward under
the protection of their shield.
until they are right on top of our cannons,
then they'll blow them away.
We'll figure out a way.
Come on, Master, let's go.
If we survive this, Snips,
you and I are gonna have a talk.
They make quite a pair, don't they, sir?
You think they have a chance?
They better.
If they can't turn off that shield generator
before it reaches the heavy cannons
there'll be no escape for any of us.
What's the status?
It looks like those bounty hunters
went up there.
Contact General Windu.
Tell him we found the Hutt.
Yes, Commander?
We've discovered that Jabba the Hutt.
has also hired bounty hunters
to track down his son
and we followed them to
a monastery on planet Teth.
We feel it's where
Jabba's son is being held
but it's too heavily fortified for us
to do anything alone, sir.
Commander, stay out of sight
and await further orders.
Will do, General.
Unusual, it is, a problem Obi-Wan
has, subduing the droid army.
I'll take care of it.
Get me Admiral Wurtz.
I need three of his star cruisers.
Yes, General.
Greater than we think,
this mystery may be.
Go with the fleet
to aid Master Kenobi, I will.
So, what's the plan?
I thought
you were the one with the plan.
No, I'm the one with enthusiasm.
You're the one with the experience, which
I'm looking forward to learning from.
Well, first, we need to get behind
that shield, then get past their tank lines.
Why don't we just go around?
Outflank them?
That'd take too long.
Sneak through the middle, then?
Impossible.



Jason, I don't think
the pig lizard was Gorignak.
What the hell you talking about?
Oh, darn.
Digitize me!
Come on, Fred.
Come on, guys. Digitize me!
Oh, no, not me.
Come on, they
They based it on your hand movements.
Am I the only one
who saw that thing inside out?
No, no, no.
I'm not the guy.
I'm not Tech Sergeant Chen,
I'm Fred Kwan.
I'm not even
Kwan's not even my real name.
Fred's no good, Jason.
You're just gonna have to kill it.
Kill it?
Well, I'm open to any suggestions.
Go for the eyes, like in episode 22!
It doesn't have any eyes, Tommy.
Go for the mouth or the throat,
its vulnerable spots!
It's a rock.
It doesn't have any vulnerable spots!
I know! You construct a weapon.
Look around you.
Can you form some sort of
rudimentary lathe?
A lathe! Get off the line, Guy!
Alexander, you're my advisor.
Advise me!
Well, you're just gonna have to
figure out what it wants.
What is its motivation?
It's a rock monster.
It doesn't have motivation.
See, that's your problem, Jason.
You were never serious about the craft.
Fred! Fred, can you hear me?
Fred, are you there?
Kind of.
You can do it, Fred! It's up to you!
Oh, no, no, no.
Jason, I'll just I'll just mess it up.
You did it for four years on the show!
Do it now!
That was the show. I'm not that guy!
Fred, you never forgot a line!
You never missed a mark!
That's not me anymore man.
It is you, Fred. You just stopped trying.
You can do this, Fred! I know
in my heart you're gonna save my life.
I am?
No doubt about it, Fred.
Fred!
Fred, can you hear me?
Fred!
Fred? I don't want to die down here.
Digitize me, Fred!
Oh, wow.
Tech Sergeant Chen.
Yeah!
I see you managed to get your shirt off.
I did it.
Welcome back, Fred.
All right, did we get
the beryllium sphere installed?
Yes, we are back to full power.
Great! Engines and pods?
Fully operational.
Perfect!
Well, crank this sucker up,
you could drop us off
and you guys can be back in
your home planet before supper.
Oh, no, sir,
we have no reason to go back.
Sure you do. Family, friends. Come on!
We are all that is left.
I didn't know that.
Sir, I have raised the command deck.
Mathesar, meet us
up at the command deck.
Mathesar.
Mathesar! Quellek!
Why can't we reach them?
Commander. Thank God you're alive.
Now you will face justice, Sarris.
At every turn, you demonstrate
the necessity for your extermination!
Leave him alone.
You wish to save the life of this man?
Yeah. Yes.
Then tell me, what does it do,
this Omega 13?
I don't know what it does.
I said I don't know!
Is it a bomb?
I don't know.
A booby trap?
I don't know!
Tell me!
I don't know!
Do you think I'm a fool?
That the Commander does not know
every bolt, every weld in his ship?
Prepare a tear harness
for the female.
No! Gwen, no!
You brute! Let go of me!
I'm not the Commander.
What did you say?
I said, "I'm not the Commander. "
Leave them alone.
There's no reason to hurt them.
They don't know anything.
Explain.
Gwen, show him
the historical documents.
Computer,
show the historical documents
of the Galaxy Quest missions.
Wonderful.
You have all done far greater damage
than I ever could have.
Bravo!
Bravo.
This is a moment I will treasure.
Explain to him who you all really are.
Tell him!
Explain!
Mathesar, there's no such person
as Captain Taggart.
My name is Jason Nesmith.
I am an actor.
We're all actors.
He doesn't understand.
Explain as you would a child.
We pretended.
We lied.
Yes! You understand that,
don't you, Mathesar?
Mathesar, I'm not a commander. I
There's no National Space
Exploration Administration.
We don't have a ship.
But there it is.
That ship is that big.
But inside, I see many rooms.
You've seen plywood sets
that look like the inside.
Our beryllium sphere is wire
with plaster around it.
And our
Our digital conveyor is
Christmas tree lights.
It's a decoration. It's all fake.
Just like me.
But why?
It's difficult to explain.
On our planet, we
We pretend to entertain and
Mathesar, I am so sorry.
God, I am so sorry.
So now you know.
Lieutenant Lathe,
hardwire the reactor core to overload.
I would like to blow
this troublesome vehicle to dust.
Sarris, what about my people?
Yes, far too simple a death for them,
isn't it?
Lathe, open an oxygen seal on level C.
Let the air in a bit for our friends.
Son of a
Release them
into space.
Core overload.
Emergency shutdown overridden.
Core implosion
estimated in nine minutes.
Core overload.
Emergency shutdown overridden.
Hey!
Core implosion
estimated in nine minutes.
Where's the happy ending, Jason?
"Never give up. Never surrender. "
Maybe it's about time
you just backed off,
you fin-headed monstrosity.
Jason.
You what?
You're starting to act
like you did in episode 17,
you scene-stealing hack.
Oh, right!
Well, how does it feel, Jason?
Was it worth it? You've murdered us all!
Shut up.
Hundreds to die just because of you!
I told you to shut up!
Both of you, get in there.
Hundreds to die,
just because you want to play
at being commander, you raving lunatic.
Then I'll see you in hell, won't I?
Look out, Jason!
Get his gun! Get the gun!
Take that!
Sorry The door's a little sticky.
Did you see that?
I'll get one of my boys up here
with a can of WD-40.
You used to pull your punches.
Scene-stealing hack? Thank you.
Raving egomaniac?
Wonder where I got that from?
Hey, guys.
Look.
They're suffocating.
Core overload.
Emergency shutdown overridden.
Core implosion
estimated in eight minutes.
General, your transport
is ready for departure.
Core overload.
Emergency shutdown overridden.
Core implosion
estimated in seven minutes.
Computer, shut down the core.
Unable.
Memory checksum invalid.
Core systems hardware damaged.
All right, all right, listen up.
This is what we gotta do.
Gwen, you and I, we're gonna get to
the core and shut it down manually.
Fred, take Guy and Laliari.
You find that valve, shut it off,
before those Thermians run out of air.
Alexander, get to the barracks,
see if you can't wedge a door open
in case they can't do that.
Okay.
Wait, Jason. What about me?
What do I do?
You're gonna practice driving. Let's go!
Practice driving.
So we get to shut down
a neutron reactor?
That's right.
Well, I hate to break it to you, Jason,
but I don't know
how to shut down a neutron reactor,
and unless you took a Learning Annex
course I don't know about,
I'm pretty sure you don't know how
to shut down a neutron reactor, either.
No, I don't,
but I know someone who does.
Brandon, honey, the garbage.
Mother, I'm quite busy.
Come on, Brandon,
don't make me ask you again.
Just 10 more minutes, okay, Ma?
I promise.
Hello? Anybody there?
Hello?
Got him. Listen to me.
This is Jason Nesmith.
I play Commander Peter Quincy
Taggart, NSEA Protector.
We accidentally traded voxes the other
day when we bumped into each other.
Commander, I see. Okay.
What's your name, son?
Brandon.
Brandon, I remember you.
From the convention, right?
You asked all those little
technical questions about the ship,
and I was a little short with you.
Yes, yes, I know, Commander,
and I actually wanna
I just wanted to tell you that
I thought a lot about what you said
It's okay. Now, listen.
But I want you to know
that I'm not
a complete brain case, okay?
I understand completely
that it's just a TV show.
Hold Wait a minute
I know there's no beryllium sphere
Stop. Stop for a second. Stop. Wait.
 no digital conveyor, no ship.
It's all real.
Oh, my God, I knew it.
I knew it! I knew it!
The crew and I are in a lot of trouble
and we need your help.
Core overload.
Emergency shutdown overridden.
Core implosion
estimated in six minutes.
Sir, it's you. Thank Ipthar.
Quellek? What are you doing up there?
I avoided capture
by using your Mak'tar stealth haze.
Where is everyone?
Come with me. I'll explain on the way.
All right, we're at level C, hallway five.
Now what?
Go to weapons storage,
your second left, through the passage.
Now, that leads to
a system of utility corridors
through the bowels of the ship.
Open.
You know what? I'm gonna get Kyle.
He knows the utility tunnel system
better than anybody alive.
All right. All we have to do
is turn off the valve to the barracks.
Hi, Brandon.
No time for pleasantries, Kyle.
We have a level 5 emergency.
You've still got the utility systems
walk-through, right?
Yeah, I've got sectors one through 28.
I think Hollister has the upper levels.
Great, we'll get everybody online.
PedaI to the metaI, Commander.
Pedal to the metal, Commander.
General! I have just received word
that the commander of the Protector
and his command crew
have escaped custody.
What?
Find them!
But, sir! My men
The core implosion is not reversible.
Find them!
All right, Brandon,
I see five ducts in this room.
Which way do we go?
Enter the passage second to your left,
and just continue straight for 50 meters.
Ducts? Why is it always ducts?
There will be a slight drop.
Thanks for the heads-up, Brandon!
You okay?
They're dying.
Wait a minute.
We gotta go across this thing?
Yes.
Don't look down.
Commander, what I'd give
to see what you're seeing.
What are you talking about?
You're deep in the underbelly
of the Omega 13!
It must be spectacular.
Well, it doesn't look like much to me.
Just these few walls
and this dumb spinning fan
that we have in every single
Brandon, what does
the Omega 13 device do?
Many have believed
that it is a matter-collapser.
A bomb capable of destroying pretty
much everything in about 13 seconds.
But myself and others are convinced
that what it is is a matter-rearranger,
effecting a 13-second time jump
to the past.
Why 13 seconds?
That's really not enough time
to do anything of any importance.
It'd be time to redeem a single mistake.
What?
Come on! Go, go, go, go!
Fleeg, we gotta turn off that valve.
Their oxygen's almost gone.
Listen, I'll go in. I'll create a distraction.
I got this. I'm okay,
I might be able to hold them back
long enough for the aliens to escape.
That's suicide.
I'm just a glorified extra, Fred.
I'm a dead man anyway.
If I'm gonna die,
I'd rather go out a hero than a coward.
Guy, Guy,
maybe you're the plucky comic relief.
You ever think about that?
Plucky?
Well, besides,
I just had this really interesting idea.
Are you stoned?
Gotta get it open, give them some time.
Sir, perhaps together,
the Mak'tar chant of strength,
"Larak tarath. "
Larak tarath, larak tarath.
Larak tarath.
Larak tarath, larak tarath, larak tarath!
Larak tarath, larak tarath, larak tarath!
All right, Brandon, we're across.
Now what?
You want to take a left and then just
straight on through the chompers.
"The chompers"?
Well, screw that.
How are we supposed
to get through this?
Hollister, do you have
the sequence yet?
Okay, the sequence is 2242
What is this thing?
 2242
I mean, there's no useful purpose
for there to be
a bunch of chompy-crushy
things in the middle of a hallway!
Gwen! Gwen!
No, I think we shouldn't have to do this.
It makes no logical sense!
Why is it here?
'Cause it's on the television show!
Well, forget it!
I am not doing it!
This episode was badly written!
Okay, Commander, now,
as soon as the first crusher hits you
It just did!
Okay, go now.
Go!
Go!
Stop!
Go!
Come on, come on, come on.
Go!
Go! Go!
No, stop! Stop!
Go!
Stop! Wait a minute! No!
I want you to jump, Commander, jump!
Whoever wrote this episode should die!
This should be interesting.
It's the simple things
in life you treasure.
That's great.
Now, we better get
Hey, get a room, guys, okay?
Hey, Fred.
That's not right.
Sir, the pressure, it's normalizing.
Open!
We are saved.
He has saved us.
Commander Taggart has saved us!
It's just not fair.
All right, Quellek,
let's get back to the command deck.
I'm I'm shot.
Quellek? Quellek?
It's not too bad.
We'll get you to the medical quarters
and you'll be fine.
It has been my greatest honor
to serve with you.
I have been blessed, sir. I
Don't speak, Quellek.
You'll forgive my impertinence, sir,
but even though
we had never before met,
I always considered you
as a father to me.
Quellek,
by Grabthar's hammer,
by the sons of Warvan,
you shall be avenged.
All right, Brandon, I'm here.
How do I shut this thing down?
Okay, just push the blue button.
The blue button? Is that it?
Yeah, why, what's wrong?
Nothing, I just thought
it'd be more complicated than that.
Core implosion estimated
in 20 seconds.
Brandon, it's not working. Brandon!
Mother, I cannot stress enough
the severity
of the Commander's predicament.
Don't forget the recyclables!
Core implosion
estimated in 10 seconds.
-9,8
Gwen, I

I've always
 5,4
Jason, Jason.
3,2,1.
It always stops at one on the show.
What were you saying?
Sir!
What?
The core detonation sequence
on the Protector has been aborted.
Impossible! Impossible!
Lock a complement of implosion
missiles onto the Protector.
Tear her apart!
He's finished, he's finished.
Alexander, listen to me.
It's okay, it's okay.
The Thermians can handle it from here.
We gotta go. Come on.
We need that armor back up!
Get me a forward view right now!
Plasma armor engaged.
All right, Tommy, see if you can't
lose them in that minefield.
Minefield?
Pedal to the metal, right now!
Pedal to the metal!
All right, let's go!
Good going, Tommy. Great going.
Thrust ahead, full!
Into the field, go!
Tommy, can you get us closer
to these mines?
Closer?
I could try.
General, I've lost them.
The magnetism of the minefield
is disrupting our instruments.
Wait! I see something.
Yes. Yes! There they are.
Get back on their tail.
I can't, sir.
What? Why not?
Because they're coming right at us.
Fire at will.
We're getting hammered, Jason!
Return fire?
No! Divert all energy to the armor!
How adorable!
The actors
are going to play war with me.
Sarris' ship accelerating toward us
at mark two.
Accelerate to mark four.
Let me remind you, sonny,
I am a general.
If you are counting on me to blink,
then you are making a deadly mistake.
Well, let me tell you something, Sarris.
It doesn't take a great actor
to recognize a bad one.
You're sweating!
Armor almost gone, Jason!
You fool! You fail to realize
that with your armor gone,
my ship will tear through yours
like tissue paper.
And what you fail to realize is
my ship is dragging mines.
Oh, no! Turn, turn!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes! Yes! Yes!
This is fantastic!
Mathesar!
Oh, my God, you're alive.
Come here.
"The ship was a model as big as this. "
A very clever deception indeed.
Set a course for home, Commander?
Can you do that?
Yeah, it's just point and click.
But we're going to have to go through
the black hole, though.
Any objections?
All right, set her up.
What's the matter, Mathesar?
We were hoping
you could come with us.
My people have no commander.
Mathesar, I think your people
have a great commander,
sir.
All right, Tommy,
take us into the black hole.
We're out!
We're going home!
Systems register functional.
All systems are working, Commander.
Jason, before the black hole,
there was an energy surge
from Sarris' ship.
Let's not worry about that
right now, Alexander.
Fred, what are you doing up here?
Shouldn't you be downstairs until we
Hey, you know,
you could put an eye out with that thing.
Fred?
No!
Mathesar!
Activate the Omega 13!
We're out!
We're going home!
Systems register functional.
All systems are working, Commander.
Jason, before the black hole,
there was
an energy surge from Sarris' ship.
Jason, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
Let go of me. Let It's not Fred!
That's Sarris. Listen to me!
I'm telling you, it's not Fred,
that's Sarris!
He's gonna try to kill all of us!
Never give up. Never surrender.
Jason! Jason! I can't slow it down!
Our ship is too big
to enter the atmosphere.
We need to separate, or we'll die.
We gotta do it.
It's our only hope, Mathesar. Thank you.
Crew to the secondary deck.
Mathesar!
Goodbye, my friends.
Fred, get up to command deck.
We're separating.
On, Teb, on!
This is the third day of the Galaxy Con,
and Jason Nesmith and his entire crew
are no-shows here at the big event,
much to the disappointment
of all these fans.
Bye. Be back soon!
Well Wait. Brandon, where are you
going with all those fireworks?
The Protectorgot super-accelerated
