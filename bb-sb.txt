As is your grandson.
I think Brock may have been poisoned with something called ricin.
Shut up! Why did you poison him? Who do you know? Gus allowed children to be murdered.
Gus! I'm gonna kill him.
Then let me help.
Don't go! Don't go! No! No! What did you say to Gus? Because he's on to us.
Yeah.
I didn't say jack.
What do you mean he's on to us? He's walking to his car.
Then suddenly he isn't.
What, does he have some kind of sixth sense? Jesus, what did you say to him? Could I ask my own question right now, at this point? Did you just bring a bomb into a hospital? What? Was I supposed to leave it on his car? What, you're supposed to bring it into a hospital? Oh, my God.
Look.
Where can we find Gus? Name a place.
Name me one place where I could surprise him, where he won't see me coming.
Because his house, the laundry, the restaurant, the factory farm, they're all wired with cameras.
One place.
Think.
Jesse, think.
Where is it? Where? Because if you can't tell me, we are dead.
Jesse.
I don't I don't know.
Well, maybe Excuse me.
Jesse Pinkman? Uh, yeah.
Hi.
Detective Kalanchoe.
This is Detective Munn, Albuquerque Police.
We were wondering if we could have a few minutes of your time, maybe go someplace and talk.
About what? Sorry, sir, I didn't catch your name.
About what? It concerns Brock Cantillo and a statement you made to his mother.
How about you come with us? We just want to clear a few things up.
No big deal.
Am I under arrest? No, you're not under arrest.
We're just talking.
So if I get tired of talking, want to get up and leave We'd prefer you didn't.
You'd prefer, so Jesse, why did you tell Brock's mom that the boy had been poisoned? Look, I think this has been, you know, uh, what do you call it? Overblown, because all I basically said was "Have the doctors thought maybe Brock got poisoned?You know, in a cover-all-bases kind of sense.
Yeah.
No, I'm sure they appreciated that, you helping them out like that, especially with how specific you were and all.
Ricin.
Wow.
Yeah, ricin that's definitely a big one.
You don't see that every day, so when doctors, they hear that, they take it very seriously, as do we, as does the FBI.
Okay.
And nice, you trying to help out like that and all, you know, professional courtesy, sharing your expertise.
I ain't go no expertise.
All right? I just, you know You just happen to guess this one rare poison might be the thing that put this little boy in the hospital.
And congratulations, because his doctors, they're beginning to think that you might just be right.
So why ricin? Jesse, how did you come up with that? Man, I think I've I don't know.
I must've saw it on House or something.
Huh.
Yeah, you know, like House or the Discovery Channel.
Sometimes your brain just makes these connections.
Does it? Mine does.
That's interesting.
Look, I've got to get back.
But we're still talking.
So I'm not under arrest, but I can't leave.
So, then, I guess I should call my lawyer.
Right? We're just having a simple conversation, Jess.
Why can't we keep talking, keep it light? Man, you know how it is when the lawyers get to it.
Suddenly everything's a big pissing match, like, every time.
Adversarial.
Adversarial.
Then we gotta book you, blah, blah.
Right? I mean, you know.
You've been around the block, Jesse.
You're no boy scout.
Saul Goodman.
That's my guy.
So do I gotta call him, or do you? What the hell do you think you're doing? I need Saul.
I need him right now.
So you break into the place.
You just break in! Jesus! You're here, by the way.
If you'd had bothered answering the phone or the door, maybe I wouldn't have Forget it.
Is he here? Is that a serious question? Why would he be here? You know where he is, don't you? I need a number.
Look.
Let me explain something to you.
My partner and I Are in danger? Whoop-dee-freaking-doo.
Why do you think he's not here? And how's that news, exactly, the two of you being in danger, after doing something idiotic? And what gives you the right to break down my door? Look, I just need a number.
Okay? That's all.
You are such a pain in my ass.
You know that? You're the reason I've got to go on unemployment for God knows how long.
I was at least looking forward to getting out of here in the next half hour, but no! Now I've got to wait around all day for a plate glass guy to come and fix this door, and who pays for this? Okay, you know what? Here, look.
I'm giving you everything, all of it, okay? There's one, two, three Look, there's got to be at least $1,700 there, okay? That will more than cover the cost of the door.
Now, I apologize profusely.
Please, the phone number.
Door like this is going to cost way more than 1,700.
What? For a plate of glass? No.
Oh, yeah, I bet it does.
I bet you it winds up costing Are you insane? Who the hell is going to charge $20,000 for a plate glass door? There's no reputable vendor w Now I'm thinking 25.
I'll be right back.
Yes, Albuquerque, New Mexico.
The number of Rebecca Simmons, Would you connect it for me, please? Thank you.
Becky, hi, it's Walter White.
Listen, I wa I'm-I'm I'm fine.
I'm fine.
How are you? Oh, good, good.
Yes, cats are Listen, Skyler and I are out of town.
We're on our way up to Santa Fe, and Junior just told us that he thinks he may have left the burner on, on the stove.
Yes, God forbid there's a fire.
Well, that's that's why I'm calling.
I just wanted to ask, and I'm sorry to do this, but do you still have the key? You do? Good.
And would you be willing to Oh, you are a life saver.
Thank you so much.
Yes.
Okay.
Okay, I'll await your call.
Thank you so much.
Bye-bye.
There you go.
Becky? Oh.
Oh, that's good.
That's a relief.
I owe you one, big time.
So how's he doing? Yo, you could at least say, instead of being a couple of dicks about it.
Jesse, if you cared at all about that little boy, prove it to me.
Tell us what you know.
I told you what I know.
Tell us again.
What are you, like like broken records? I was trying to be helpful.
End of story.
Guess we'll have to wait and see what the tox screen says.
Oh, look at this.
Isn't this cozy? What did you tell them? I told them they were a couple of dicks.
He's a wordsmith.
Well, Detectives, it's been a pleasure.
Now, up you go.
Make like you've got manners.
Make like you respect the rule of law.
Au revoir, auf Wiedersehen, hasta luego, get the hell out.
Buh-bye.
That's it.
Pick it up.
Follow your partner.
And one, two Thank you.
Christ.
You two.
All I can say is if I ever get anal polyps, I'll know what to name them.
You gonna get me out of here? Ah.
Hm.
No.
Not even if I could.
You know, the FBI's going to show up on this ricin thing, and then you're in it for the duration.
You know, you're a lot safer in here.
They just tried to get your partner in his own home.
Jesus.
Is he okay? Well, he's okay like a fruit fly's okay.
We're all on the clock here, and thanks for that, by the way.
You two want to stick your wangs in a hornet's nest, it's a free country, but how come I always gotta get sloppy seconds, huh? Have you got anything for me? I mean, tell me I didn't poke my head up for nothing.
Yeah.
I've been thinking.
And? Casa Tranquila.
What's Casa Tranquila? It's an old folks' home off Paseo Del Norte.
Our boy tells me Fring took him there to visit one of the patients, someone Pinkman says you'll definitely remember Tio Salamanca.
Old guy in a wheelchair.
Um, doesn't talk, rings a bell.
I don't mean "Does that ring a bell?I mean, the guy actually has to ring a bell.
I Yes, I know.
I remember.
So what, once every blue moon, Gus goes and visits an old cartel associate.
That That doesn't help me.
I can't very well hide out in a nursing home for six months, hoping, on the off chance, that he comes back.
It's not even like they're friends.
Pinkman said it was like he was torturing the old guy.
What does that mean? He told him the last of his family was dead.
He seemed to enjoy telling him.
Afterward, Pinkman asked him about it.
All Gus would say was that this Tio character once murdered someone close to him.
Wait.
Tio murdered someone close to Gus? I know it sound not particularly fruitful, but, sorry, that's all I got.
They're enemies, not friends.
Your next number in this coverall game, where you cover the whole shmoley, is B number 3 like Goldilocks and the Three Bears.
That's number 3 in your B column, followed by O-74.
That's O-74 on the other side of your card.
Now we have that lucky number B number 7.
Is it lucky for you? B-7.
In the "Irow, 2-1.
I know you despise me, and I know how badly you want to see me dead, but I'm willing to bet that I know a man whom you hate even more.
Those Ns just keep coming.
They're all sticking together.
I am offering you an opportunity for revenge.
Column 4-8, the continental United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii.
Okay, I'm here.
How you doing this morning, Mr.
Salamanca? You need something? You need to go poopie? Huh? Did you go poopie already? No? What do you need? Want me to get the board for you? Okay.
All right.
Okay, here we go.
A-E-I-O-U I don't think we're finished, Mr.
Salamanca.
A-E-I-O-U Finish the word, Mr.
Salamanca.
Is it "dear"? Is it "deal"? Honey, "deaain't a word.
Help me out here.
Hey, son, what's up? When exactly are you getting here? Uh, just as soon as I can.
Look, this is a serious situation, and it's like you're not taking it seriously.
Give me the phone.
Let me talk to him.
No, son, I am taking it very seriously.
Just Just give it to me, Walt.
I'm very concerned about your Uncle Hank and his safety, but whomever is making these threats against him, I can assure you there's no interest in me.
I'm not on on anyone's radar, and besides your mother and I.
Give it to me.
Walter? Did you hear what he said? Get over here.
No more excuses.
Marie, I will be there just as soon as I can.
I promise.
Hold on.
You want to weigh in here? Maybe you could talk some sense into him.
Marie, he'll get here when he gets here, so just Well, I hope you sell plenty of air fresheners.
I hope you just have a banner day over there.
Okay, Walt? Don't worry about a thing here.
Goodbye.
And thank you for all of your help.
Huh? Anything? Hi, everyone.
Hi, Steve.
How's everybody holding up? Hey, Gomie, just the man I want to see.
Come here, look at this.
Jesus, enough with the laundry.
No, no, no, hear me out.
This panel, if I'm reading it correctly, is a 7,200-amp service.
This place has two of them.
All right? That's a whole lot of juice, brother.
Laundry this size typically has maybe half that, okay? So what's with the extra panel? What are you, Thomas Edison now? No, I asked a bunch of electricians.
They have their own chat rooms, you know, like where all they talk about was wiring? Freakin' Internet find anything on it these days.
What do you say? Pop over, have another look-see? Listen.
I think we possibly have a lead on something.
Yeah? I have this guy down at the office.
He says he has some kind of information.
The thing is, he'll only give it to you, in person.
Okay.
Remember Hector Salamanca? Sh Yeah.
What, you mean the old cripple guy with the bell? Rather crap on our floor than talk to us? No, I don't remember him at all.
Why? Well, he's the guy.
His nurse calls us, says he wants to powwow.
So we have this guy at the office for three hours, and he still just wants to talk to you.
Do not even think about going down there.
Marie.
This is clearly a ploy or a trick or something designed to get Hank out into the open.
That's all this is.
That's what we thought.
Well.
It's been years since this guy's been a player.
His nephew's gone.
Doesn't have anybody.
The nurse checks out doesn't know nothing.
Guess I just don't see an angle in it, if there even is one.
Of course, if you did want to talk to this guy, there's not safer place than the office.
I don't think this sounds like a good idea.
Yeah, I agree, Uncle Hank.
It is a ridiculous idea, and there is no way you are going to do it, end of story.
Hank, thanks for coming down.
No problem at all.
Good to see you, sir.
So Mr.
Salamanca.
You had something you want to tell me? A-E-I-O Row O.
First letter S.
A-E-I-O-U Second letter U.
A B-C A-E-I J-K A-E-I J-K-L-M A-E-I-O-U Row U.
V-W-X-Y All right, that's enough.
Thank you.
Yeah, thanks.
I can spell.
Well, you got that out of your system now? Shall we try this one more time? F A-E-I-O-U A B-C Yeah, we we got it.
I am I am I am just so, so sorry.
Well, at least this time he didn't shit himself.
Guess that's progress.
Yes.
We may have a problem.
I've got eyes on the DEA.
They just had a visitor Hector Salamanca.
I don't even know what to say to you right now.
You just sit here, and you think about how far that kind of behavior is going to get you.
Not far, let me tell you.
Any second thoughts? Then let's get to work.
Hello! Shh.
Mr.
Pinkman you're free to go.
Why? What happened? Tox screen came back.
No ricin poisoning.
Surprised, huh? No, why should I be? Your jacket.
Till we meet again.
Hey, yo! Yo! Right here.
Hey, Andrea, I'm just checking on Brock.
Uh, hey, it sounds like I mean, listen, just call me if you can, all right? I'm headed back over.
Hey, excuse me.
Yes.
We just picked up Pinkman.
No witnesses.
What about Hector? I've checked inside and out.
No wires, no camera, no surveillance.
A police cruiser rolled through about an hour ago.
Seemed routine.
It's just him, alone in his room.
All right.
I'm on my way.
Maybe it's better if if I do this myself.
I do this.
It's all clear.
Wait here.
What kind of man talks to the DEA? No man.
No man at all.
A crippled little rata.
What a reputation to leave behind.
Is that how you want to be remembered? Last chance to look at me, Hector.
Aah! Oh, my God.
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, Jesus.
The same vote for sure.
Hey, you know what? It's that time again, where we tell you about your own personal slice of hell known as the Albuquerque afternoon commute.
How bad are things looking out there? I'll tell you what.
Right now southbound 25 has got an accident there at Jefferson on the right shoulder, so make sure you stay to the left as you move through that area, and things have slowed to a crawl at the Big I, no surprises there, either.
All right, hang on.
I hate to interrupt you here, but I do have some breaking news here, now coming out of the North Valley, apparently.
An explosion has been reported at a nursing home, the Casa Tranquila Nursing Home.
Oh, no.
You heard of that place.
We've got very few details on it so far, unfortunately.
The initial report is, though, that as many as three people may have been killed.
Oh, no.
Now, the news is disturbing.
We're going to get you more information on this just as soon as it comes in.
Situation over there, I imagine, is pretty hectic.
What's traffic looking like? Yeah, I know where the nursing home is.
If you're moving through that area, we're going to be talking about east and westbound Paseo in that area there in the North Valley.
Please, you've got to avoid that area as you move through.
Our hearts going out to the victims of this tragedy.
We'll bring you more details just as soon as we get them.
Coming up on Coyote 102.
5 Aerosmith, Def Leppard.
Keep it right here on New Mexico's finest rock.
You wanna cook with a broken arm? Next step, CO2.
Do it.
Hey.
I better hear them click.
What, you got a problem with stairs? Please, please Gus is dead.
We've got work to do.
V�monos.
Uh, he's going to pull through.
Yeah? Yeah, it looked kind of touch-and-go there for a while, but he's gonna he's gonna make it.
Thank God.
Oh, thank God.
You know, still saying it wasn't the ricin.
I don't understand.
Then what was it? Saying it was most likely a flower called lily of the valley.
Yeah, it's it's, like, common.
It's got these red berries on it that I guess taste sweet, and sometimes little kids eat them and wind up poisoning themselves, and that's it, nothing more.
So Gus didn't poison him after all.
Still, he he had to go, right? You're damn right.
Gus had to go.
Um, you know, I should I should get back.
Andrea's waiting.
I'm here at Casa Tranquila, where three people are dead following an explosion that rocked this elderly care facility earlier today.
The fireball completely consumed one resident's room and damaged common areas nearby.
Walt? Tell Dad to turn on his TV.
Shh.
Walt, let me get somewhere where I can hear you.
Tell him Uncle Hank was right.
Shh.
Walt? How are you doing? How am I doing? How are you doing? I'm, uh I'm doing quite well.
I'm good.
Jesus, Walt, the news here.
Gus Fring is dead.
He was blown up along with some person from some Mexican cartel, and the DEA has no idea what to make of it.
Do you know about this? Walt? I need you to It's over.
We're safe.
Was this you? What happened? I won.

What the hell? Killer robot.
We built it.
Yeah, well, it almost killed me.
If it wanted to kill you, you'd be dead.
So, who exactly does it want to kill? I'm sorry, are you unaware of the upcoming Southern California Robot Fighting League Round Robin Invitational? You know, since I moved last year, not all my mail has been forwarded.
It's a big deal.
There's an awards banquet and a dance afterward.
Perhaps you'd like to come with me.
I know the other fellas would be really excited to see a girl there.
How is it supposed to be a dance if I'm the only girl? Well, that may be a slight exaggeration.
You'd be the only doable girl.
You are a pig, Howard.
How is "doableanything but a compliment? Why don't we just work on the robot? Please, not now.
Once again, Penny and I have begun our little tango.
Our tango? The carnal repartee, the erotic to and fro.
I'm begging you, stop talking.
Look, normally I can just ignore you.
I get it you're a little peculiar.
Like Sheldon.
Excuse me, Penny, but in this room, you're the one who's peculiar.
You might be right.
But back to you.
I know you think you're some sort of smooth-talking ladies' man, but the truth is, you are just pathetic and creepy.
So what are you saying? I am saying it is not a compliment to call me "doable.
It's not sexy to stare at my ass and say, "It must be jelly 'cause jam don't shake like that.
And most important, we are not dancing a tango, we're not to'ing and fro'ing.
Nothing is ever going to happen between us.
Ever.
Wait a minute.
This isn't flirting.
You're serious.
Flirting? You think I'm flirting with you? I am not flirting with you.
No woman is ever gonna flirt with you.
You're just gonna grow old and die alone.
Thanks for the heads up.
Where you going? I'm going home to live my creepy, pathetic life.
Someone had to say it.
What? He said maybe we should enter you in the killer robot competition.
Howard, the phone is ringing! Here's a crazy idea, Ma: Answer it! All right, hold on.
It's your friend, Leonard! He wants to know why you're not at school today! I don't go to school, Ma.
I work at a university.
That's a school! Now pick up the phone! I don't want to talk to anybody.
Should I ask Leonard to bring over your homework?! I don't have homework.
I'm a grown man with a master's degree in engineering! Excuse me, Mr.
Fancy-Pants.
Want me to get you a Popsicle? Cherry, please! I ate the cherry.
All that's left is green.
You make me want to kill myself.
What's going on? I don't know, now they're just yelling about Popsicles.
Sounds like Penny really got to him.
I'm not surprised.
Despite his hard and crusty shell, Howard is a very sensitive man.
Do you know he writes poetry? Mostly about men from Nantucket and hermits named Dave, but he does it with real sensitivity.
Hey, Hofstadter.
Word around the pwasma wab is you built a wobot? Yes, we did, Kripke.
His name is MONTE.
Well, if you have any dewusions about entering him against my wobot, the Kwipke Kwippler in the Southern California Robot Fighting League Wound Wobin Invitational, aka the S.
